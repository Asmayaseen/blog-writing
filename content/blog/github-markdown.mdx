# What is Markdown?

Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document by formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists. Markdown is mostly regular text with a few special characters like `#` or `*`.

# Syntax Guide

Here's an overview of Markdown syntax you can use anywhere on GitHub.com or in your own text files.

## Headers

As Kanye West said:

We're living the future so the present is our past.

## Inline code
```markdown
I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.
```


## Syntax highlighting

Here's an example of how you can use syntax highlighting with GitHub Flavored Markdown:

```js:fancyAlert.js
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if (arg) {
    $.facebox({ div: '#foo' })
  }
}
```

#### Rendered:

```js
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if (arg) {
    $.facebox({ div: '#foo' });
  }
}
```
## Task Lists
```markdown

- [x] List syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
- [x] This is a complete item
- [ ] This is an incomplete item
```
#### Rendered:

 List syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
 This is a complete item
 This is an incomplete item
## Tables
```markdown

| First Header                | Second Header                |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Content from cell 1         | Content from cell 2          |
| Content in the first column | Content in the second column |
```
#### Rendered:
```markdown
First Header	Second Header
Content from cell 1	Content from cell 2
Content in the first column	Content in the second column
```
## Strikethrough
```markdown
~~This text will be crossed out~~
```
#### Rendered:

## Footnotes
```markdown
Here is a simple footnote[^1].

[^1]: My reference.
```
#### Rendered:
Here is a simple footnote1.

```vbnet


This version aligns with your example and integrates structured code blocks with meta strings, line numbers, and clear titles for readability and enhanced functionality. Let me know if you need any changes!
